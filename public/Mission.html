                We are friends. We are moms. We are different races. We want a better world for our kids.
 
                We met in 2016, while volunteering for a fundraiser at our children's school. We talked about 
                the different paths that had led each of us to a mostly white school in a suburb of segregated 
                Boston. We discussed where to get our hair done and complained about the everyday inconveniences 
                of having no hair shops in our area. We fleshed out the endless ways that systemic racism and 
                oppression affects every bit of our daily lives. Then, we had honest conversations about the 
                roles we each play in upholding and dismantling that system - we covered it all! We debated 
                about the best ways to make change. <span id = "dots">...</span>
                <span id= "more">And, while it feels overwhelming to think about dismantling 
                systemic oppression, it felt exciting to dream about filling a need by opening a hair shop where 
                none exists. We talked and dreamed, and dreamed and talked… until a day in October 2019 when we 
                decided to actually do it! Never mind that we knew nothing about opening a retail business of any 
                kind. Never mind that we didn’t have a business plan or investors. We had a vision and a name and 
                the conviction to make it happen. Welcome to RepHAIRations!</span>
